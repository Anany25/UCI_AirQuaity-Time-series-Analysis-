# UCI_AirQuaity(Time Series Analysis)


Part 1: Data and Feature-engineering

1.	Nature of dataset:

The dataset comprises 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses recorded by an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors within an Air Quality Chemical Multisensory Device. These recordings were collected in a significantly polluted area at road level within an Italian city, spanning from March 2004 to February 2005.

The dataset provides insights into air quality, with ground truth hourly averaged concentrations for various pollutants, including Carbon Monoxide (CO), Non-Methanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). The reference concentrations were obtained from a co-located certified analyzer.

One may encounter challenges such as cross-sensitivities, concept drifts, and sensor drifts, as discussed in the associated literature. Missing values are indicated by the value -200.

2.	Feature Selection:
 
The features were selected following a correlation analysis with the target variable 'PT08.S4(NO2)'. The correlation coefficients between 'PT08.S4(NO2)' and all other features in the dataset were calculated. Subsequently, the top 5 features exhibiting the highest positive correlation were identified. 
To ensure the exclusion of the target variable itself, the first feature in the list was omitted. The selected features, therefore, represent those with the strongest positive correlation with 'PT08.S4(NO2)'. This approach aids in focusing on a subset of features that demonstrate a significant relationship with the target variable, potentially enhancing the efficacy of subsequent analyses or modeling tasks.

The selected features were: PTO8.S2(NMHC), PTO8.S1(CO), C6H6(GT) and T

3.	Purpose of breaking data into sequences?

Breaking time-series data into sequences is crucial for modeling temporal dependencies using techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). This approach allows for the retention of sequential information, enabling models to capture trends and dependencies over time. Sequencing also aligns with the inherent temporal nature of time-series data, enhances predictive performance by leveraging historical context, and facilitates efficient training on batches of sequential data. It is particularly useful in handling variable-length sequences and overcoming challenges like the vanishing gradient problem in neural networks.


Part 2: Modeling and Evaluation

1.	Understanding of models:

RNN:
RNNs process sequential data by iteratively feeding outputs back into the network, enabling them to learn context and relationships. While prone to vanishing gradients, they remain useful for tasks like text generation and music composition where context is crucial. The recursive nature of RNNs allows them to maintain a form of short-term memory, making them well-suited for applications that involve understanding sequential patterns in data.

LSTML:
LSTMs overcome vanishing gradients through gated memory cells, enabling them to retain information from past elements in a sequence. This long-term memory makes LSTMs ideal for tasks like machine translation and speech recognition, where capturing complex temporal dependencies is essential. The gated architecture of LSTMs, including the input, forget, and output gates, empowers them to selectively update and store information, addressing the vanishing gradient problem associated with traditional RNNs and allowing LSTMs to excel in tasks requiring a nuanced understanding of context in sequential data.

2.	Graphs and Analysis:


RNN and LSTM Predictions

Both RNN and LSTM performed exceptionally well, but RNN seems to have a little more noise in its predictions (as we can observe in the graph with the fluctuations in the green lines). Whereas the prediction by LSTM is much more stable and smoother with very little divergence from the Actual line.
Hence, we can safely conclude that LSTM performed better than RNN for this time series analysis.

This is because LSTMs can address the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the capture of long-term dependencies and nuanced patterns. With gated memory cells, LSTMs selectively retain and update information over extended sequences, making them adept at modeling complex temporal relationships in data. This contrasts with traditional RNNs, which struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and are less effective in handling extended time lags and maintaining relevant context. LSTMs, with their superior memory retention and capacity for learning dependencies with larger time lags, prove to be a more powerful solution for tasks where understanding historical context is crucial.
